My GitHub account is for collaborating with other people and classmates.
This repository is the first one I have ever created and will be used for future assignemnts. 
Some steps I had to take was to first create an GitHub account, then create a new repository, download GitHub desktop, log in, click clone repository, and put it into a file location on my machine.
