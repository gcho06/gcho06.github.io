  -I'm also a sports lover. I play lacrosse and soccer, so I enjoy playing pick up soccer with my friends or just pass around wiht my brother, who also loves soccer. 
##Websites I recommend 
  -[Netflix](www.netflix.com)Movies and TV Show watching is one of the many things I love to do in my free time. Watching old and new movies and deciphering the deep meaning or light messages of the movies is interesting to me.
